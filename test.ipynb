In October 1947, tribal forces from Pakistan invaded Kashmir, prompting its ruler to accede to India in exchange for military assistance.

      "flashpoint. Both nations have fought three major wars over the region and countless smaller clashes. The LoC is frequently the site of ceasefire violations, cross-border shelling, and militant infiltration. The situation escalated dramatically in 2019 when India revoked Article 370, stripping Jammu and Kashmir of its special status. Pakistan responded by downgrading diplomatic ties and suspending trade and transport links. Cross-Border Terrorism and Recent Escalations A persistent source of tension is cross-border terrorism. India accuses Pakistan of supporting militant groups that operate in Kashmir, citing attacks such as the 2008 Mumbai attacks and the 2019 Pulwama suicide bombing. India has responded with surgical strikes and air raids on alleged terrorist camps in Pakistan, notably the Balakot airstrike in 2019. The most recent escalation occurred in April 2025, when a deadly attack in Indian-administered Kashmirâ€™s Pahalgam killed 26 civilians. India blamed Pakistan-based militants and, on May 7, launched \"Operation Sindoor,\" a series of missile and drone strikes targeting what it called \"terrorist infrastructure\" in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Pakistan countered with its own military actions, including claims of downing Indian aircraft and retaliatory shelling across the LoC. Both sides have reported civilian casualties, and the risk of a broader conflict looms large. Nuclear Dimension and Global Concern Both India and Pakistan possess nuclear weapons, making their confrontations particularly alarming for the international community. Each episode of escalation prompts urgent calls for restraint from global leaders, who fear that even a limited conflict could spiral into a catastrophic nuclear exchange. Attempts at Peace Despite cycles of violence, there have been efforts at rapprochement. In 2021, both countries agreed to a renewed ceasefire along the LoC, raising hopes for dialogue. However, mistrust, unresolved grievances, and recurring violence have repeatedly undermined such initiatives. Conclusion The India-Pakistan conflict is a complex interplay of historical grievances, territorial disputes, religious identities, and geopolitical rivalries. Kashmir remains the epicenter of their animosity, with periodic escalations threatening regional and global stability. Until both sides find a durable political solution, the specter of conflict will continue to shadow South Asia India and Pakistan, two neighboring nations in South Asia, have endured a fraught and often hostile relationship since their simultaneous independence and partition in 1947. The roots of their conflict are deeply entwined with the territorial dispute over Kashmir, a region both claim in full but each controls in part. Historical Background The seeds of discord were sown during the 1947 partition, which created India and Pakistan as separate states. The princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, with a largely Muslim population but a Hindu ruler, became the focal point of their rivalry. In October 1947, tribal forces from Pakistan invaded Kashmir, prompting its ruler to accede to India in exchange for military assistance. This led to the First Indo-Pakistani War, ending in a UN-brokered ceasefire in 1949 and the establishment of a de facto border, the Line of Control (LoC), dividing Kashmir between the two countries. Subsequent decades saw repeated wars and skirmishes-most notably in 1965 and 1971. The 1971 conflict, triggered by the Bangladesh Liberation War, resulted in the creation\n"
